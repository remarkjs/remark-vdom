<p>Lots of entities are supported:  , &amp;, ©, Æ,
Ď, ¾, ℋ, ⅆ,
∲, &amp;c.  Even some entities with a missing
terminal semicolon are parsed correctly (as per the HTML5 spec):
ÿ, á, ©, and &amp;.</p>
<p>However, &amp;MadeUpEntities; are kept in the document.</p>
<p>Entities even work in the language flag of fenced code blocks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-some—language">alert(&#39;Hello&#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>Or in <a href="~/some%E2%80%94file" title="in some plæce">línks</a></p>
<p>Or in <img src="~/an%E2%80%93image.png" alt="ímages" title="© Someone"></p>
<p>But, entities are not interpreted in <code>inline c&amp;ouml;de</code>, or in
code blocks:</p>
<pre><code>C&amp;Ouml;DE block.
</code></pre>
