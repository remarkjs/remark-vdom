# remark-vdom

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated, but
use of this package should be avoided.
Please use an alternative to vdom such as React (through `remark-rehype` and
`rehype-react`).

Legacy [documentation for this package][docs] is still available in Git.
